		<section name="FX Rate Calculation">
			<p>When you see a rate like EUR/USD of 1.6 / 1.61, it means this:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Bid: 1.6;  Quoter buys  EUR and sells USD at 1.6</li>
				<li>Ask: 1.61; Quoter sells EUR and sells USD at 1.61</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you are on the receiving end, you always end up paying more or getting less!</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If you want to sell your 1 EUR, you will get 1.6 USD</li>
				<li>If you want to sell your USD, you will have to fork 1.61 USD for 1 EUR</li>
			</ul>
		</section>
		<section name="Currency Cross Rate Calculation">
			<p>A Cross Rate is sometimes calculated based on 2 other FX Rates going through a common currency, referred to as the Cross Currency.
				Given that the
				rates are following some market conventions whereby the USD is not always the main currency, the calculation is a bit more
				complex. Note the
				differences:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>EUR/USD: 1.2; 1 Euro gives you 1.2 USD</li>
				<li>USD/CAD: 1.1; 1 USD gives you 1.1 CAD</li>
				<li>GBP/USD: 1.6; 1 GBP gives you 1.6 USD</li>
			</ul>
			<p>So what should the calculation be for EUR/GBP? or GBP/CAD? Furthermore the calculation becomes more confusing if you consider Bid and Ask...To
				put it simply
				in the words of "Mastering Financial Calculations":
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Given two exchange rates A/B and A/C, the cross rate are:</li>
				<li>B/C = A/C divided by A/B</li>
				<li>and C/B = A/B divided by A/C</li>
				<li>But you need to use the opposite side when calculating bid/ask, e.g.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>B.C Bid = A.C.bid / A.B.ask</li>
					<li>B.C Ask = A.C.ask / A.B.bid</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li>Given two exchange rates B/A and A/C, the cross rate are:</li>
				<li>B/C = B/A multiplied by A/C</li>
				<li>and C/B = 1 divided by (B/A multiplied by A/C)</li>
				<li>And you need to use the same side when calculating bid/ask, e.g.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>B.C Bid = A.C.bid * A.B.bid</li>
					<li>B.C Ask = A.C.ask * A.B.ask</li>
				</ul>
			</ul>
