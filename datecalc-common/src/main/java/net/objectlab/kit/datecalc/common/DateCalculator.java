/**
 * A DateCalculator is a lightweight container with an optional reference to a
 * set of holidays, a WorkingWeek (Mon-Fri by default), a startDate and a
 * current business date. The Calculator also uses a HolidayHandler to determine
 * what to do when the calculated current Business Date falls on a weekend or
 * holiday (non-working day). The CurrentDate date is changed every time that the
 * moveByDays or moveByBusinessDays methods are called. 'E' will be
 * parameterized to be a Date-like class, i.e. java.util.Date or
 * java.util.Calendar (and LocalDate or YearMonthDay for Joda-time / JDK8).
